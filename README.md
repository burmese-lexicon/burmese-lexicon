# Burmese Lexicon

## Background

I haven't found any open-sourced and up-to-date dictionary for Burmese language.
There are other resources like wikitionary, sea-lang, ornagi etc but they aren't actively updated and not open-sourced.

With this app, we can build a community of active contributors from different backgrounds
such as politics, religion, ethnics, professions to come together and contribute any and all words found in the Burmese corpus.


## Development
